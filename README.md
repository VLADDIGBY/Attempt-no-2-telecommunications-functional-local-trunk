# Attempt-no-2-telecommunications-functional-local-trunk
attempt to try and create a trunk using old tele phone lines. Trying too bybass the local exchange too connect straight too international source like discribed in the original "black box" blue prints with obvious soft and hardware upgrades. Manually dial in to local exchange then bypass to regional then international. First must crate a working fully functional personal trunk to use as test and analysis tool. Many of the phone company lines are left open and are no longer used. It was quicker/Cheaper too just dig open cut trenches and install brand new ducts with cables and install a whole new exchange box. Whats the point in just leaving them doing nothing?
